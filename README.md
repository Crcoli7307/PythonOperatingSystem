Welcome to Python OS!
A operating system made only of regular Python.
Operations Guide:
Upon Startup you will see a welcome message as well as some loading messages. Remember: It is normal if you see some things that say Fail beside them, this may be from an experimental feature or something that your computer may not have. You will be prompted to review a time, this should state the saved time. It should be correct if everything is working as it is supposed to. If it is correct type "y" into the command line and press enter. You will see a few messages pop up, but the final one will be asking you to create a username, make up a username, but keep in mind that your username and password will not be saved if you are in revision 0.0.1 or 0.0.2 or earlier. Remember: Neither your username or password can be empty! After you create a username and password, you will be brought to a command line! Here you can run apps or files, for a list of all of the apps that are installed, type "listapps". To install apps, type "Install" to launch the application installer.
